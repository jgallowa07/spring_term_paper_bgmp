	abstract = {The current practice for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on PCR testing of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens in a symptomatic patient at high epidemiologic risk. This testing strategy likely underestimates the true prevalence of infection, creating the need for serologic methods to detect infections missed by the limited testing to date. Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course, how the antibody response to infection develops over time, and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development.},

	abstract = {Infants of HIV-positive mothers can acquire HIV infection by various routes, but even in the absence of antiviral treatment, the majority of these infants do not become infected. There is evidence that maternal antibodies provide some protection from infection, but gestational maternal antibodies have not yet been characterized in detail. One of the most studied vertically infected infants is BG505, as the virus from this infant yielded an Envelope protein that was successfully developed as a stable trimer. Here, we isolated and characterized 39 HIV-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) from MG505, the mother of BG505, at a time point just prior to vertical transmission. These nAbs belonged to 21 clonal families and employed a variety of VH genes. Many were specific for the HIV-1 Env V3 loop, and this V3 specificity correlated with measurable antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. The isolated nAbs did not recapitulate the full breadth of heterologous or autologous virus neutralization by contemporaneous plasma. Notably, we found that the V3-targeting nAb families neutralized one particular maternal Env variant, even though all tested variants had low V3 sequence diversity and were measurably bound by these nAbs. None of the nAbs neutralized BG505 transmitted virus. Furthermore, the MG505 nAb families were found at relatively low frequencies within the maternal B cell repertoire; all were less than 0.25\% of total IgG sequences. Our findings illustrate an example of the diversity of HIV-1 nAbs within one mother, cumulatively resulting in a collection of antibody specificities that can contribute to the transmission bottleneck.IMPORTANCE Mother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1 offers a unique setting in which maternal antibodies both within the mother and passively transferred to the infant are present at the time of viral exposure. Untreated HIV-exposed human infants are infected at a rate of 30 to 40\%, meaning that some infants do not get infected despite continued exposure to virus. Since the potential of HIV-specific immune responses to provide protection against HIV is a central goal of HIV vaccine design, understanding the nature of maternal antibodies may provide insights into immune mechanisms of protection. In this study, we isolated and characterized HIV-specific antibodies from the mother of an infant whose transmitted virus has been well studied.},

While numerous discovery efforts have identified and characterized neutralizing antibodies, much less is known about antibodies that mediate ADCC. Here we describe four new antibodies that target the gp41 transmembrane protein of the HIV envelope. Competition experiments and peptide mapping studies together helped narrow down the binding sites for the four antibodies to two conserved regions of the protein. One pair of antibodies targets a common epitope of gp41 while the other pair binds to a more complex discontinuous epitope. In vitro activity assays indicated that this second pair of antibodies could drive killing against cells coated with various forms of gp41, and both pairs of antibodies could drive killing of HIV-infected cells. Inducing these types of antibodies following vaccination may represent a more straightforward path to generating a consistent, functional response to a more conserved portion of the HIV envelope protein.},

	abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is implicated in fetal stillbirth, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and ocular anomalies following vertical transmission from infected mothers. In adults, infection may trigger autoimmune inflammatory polyneuropathy. Transmission most commonly follows the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes but may also occur through sexual intercourse or receipt of blood products. Definitive diagnosis through detection of viral RNA is possible in serum or plasma within 10~days of disease onset, in whole blood within 3~weeks of onset, and in semen for up to 3~months. Serological diagnosis is nonetheless critical because few patients have access to molecular diagnostics during the acute phase of infection and infection may be associated with only mild or inapparent disease that does not prompt molecular testing. Serological diagnosis is confounded by cross-reactivity of immune sera with other flaviviruses endemic in the areas where ZIKV has recently emerged. Accordingly, we built a high-density microarray comprising nonredundant 12-mer peptides that tile, with one-residue overlap, the proteomes of Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Ilheus, Oropouche, and chikungunya viruses. Serological analysis enabled discovery of a ZIKV NS2B 20-residue peptide that had high sensitivity (96.0\%) and specificity (95.9\%) versus natural infection with or vaccination against dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis virus in a microarray assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of early-convalescent-phase sera (2 to 3~weeks after onset of symptomatic infection).IMPORTANCE The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a teratogen is a profound challenge to global public health. Molecular diagnosis of infection is straightforward during the 3-week period when patients are viremic. However, serological diagnosis thereafter of historical exposure has been confounded by cross-reactivity. Using high-density peptide arrays that tile the proteomes of a selection of flaviviruses to identify a ZIKV-specific peptide, we established two assays that enable sensitive and specific diagnosis of exposure to ZIKV. These assays may be useful in guiding clinical management of mothers at risk for potential exposure to ZIKV and enable insights into the epidemiology of ZIKV infections.},

	abstract = {Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) is a massively multiplexed, phage-display based methodology for analyzing antibody binding specificities, with several advantages over existing techniques, including the uniformity and completeness of proteomic libraries, as well as high sample throughput and low cost. Data generated by the PhIP-Seq assay are unique in many ways. The only published analytical approach for these data suffers from important limitations. Here, we propose a new statistical framework with several improvements. Using a set of replicate mock immunoprecipitations (negative controls lacking antibody input) to generate background binding distributions, we establish a statistical model to quantify antibody-dependent changes in phage clone abundance. Our approach incorporates robust regression of experimental samples against the mock IPs as a means to calculate the expected phage clone abundance, and provides a generalized model for calculating each clone{\textquoteright}s expected abundance-associated standard deviation. In terms of bias removal and detection sensitivity, we demonstrate that this z-score algorithm outperforms the previous approach. Further, in a large cohort of autoantibody-defined Sj{\"o}gren{\textquoteright}s Syndrome (SS) patient sera, PhIP-Seq robustly identified Ro52, Ro60, and SSB/La as known autoantigens associated with SS. In an effort to identify novel SS-specific binding specificities, SS z-scores were compared with z-scores obtained by screening Ropositive sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This analysis did not yield any commonly targeted SS-specific autoantigens, suggesting that if they exist at all, their epitopes are likely to be discontinuous or post-translationally modified. In summary, we have developed an improved algorithm for PhIP-Seq data analysis, which was validated using a large set of sera with clinically characterized autoantibodies. This z-score approach will substantially improve the ability of PhIP-Seq to detect and interpret antibody binding specificities.

abstract={The binding specificities of an individual's antibody repertoire contain a wealth of biological information. They harbor evidence of environmental exposures, allergies, ongoing or emerging autoimmune disease processes, and responses to immunomodulatory therapies, for example. Highly multiplexed methods to comprehensively interrogate antibody-binding specificities have therefore emerged in recent years as important molecular tools. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for performing `phage immunoprecipitation sequencing' (PhIP-Seq), which is a powerful method for analyzing antibody-repertoire binding specificities with high throughput and at low cost. The methodology uses oligonucleotide library synthesis (OLS) to encode proteomic-scale peptide libraries for display on bacteriophage. These libraries are then immunoprecipitated, using an individual's antibodies, for subsequent analysis by high-throughput DNA sequencing. We have used PhIP-Seq to identify novel self-antigens associated with autoimmune disease, to characterize the self-reactivity of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies, and in a large international cross-sectional study of exposure to hundreds of human viruses. Compared with alternative array-based techniques, PhIP-Seq is far more scalable in terms of sample throughput and cost per analysis. Cloning and expression of recombinant proteins are not required (versus protein microarrays), and peptide lengths are limited only by DNA synthesis chemistry (up to 90-aa (amino acid) peptides versus the typical 8- to 12-aa length limit of synthetic peptide arrays). Compared with protein microarrays, however, PhIP-Seq libraries lack discontinuous epitopes and post-translational modifications. To increase the accessibility of PhIP-Seq, we provide detailed instructions for the design of phage-displayed peptidome libraries, their immunoprecipitation using serum antibodies, deep sequencing--based measurement of peptide abundances, and statistical determination of peptide enrichments that reflect antibody--peptide interactions. Once a library has been constructed, PhIP-Seq data can be obtained for analysis within a week.},
